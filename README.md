# Video Piper

A tool to download videos online. Either one at a time or an entire playlist.

Built using [Quasar](https://quasar.dev/) with [Typescript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript)

This application is using [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) and [ffmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg) to download and potentially convert media.
